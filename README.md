## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Bootstrap
- Javascript


### What I learned

I'm improving my skills with js. It caused a problem for me at first when I wanted to hit enter to enter the data, the page reloaded and I didn't understand why.
I was able to solve it by adding the following line of code within the corresponding addEventListener.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
  e.preventDefault();
```

### Continued development

I will continue improving and discovering js with increasingly entertaining projects.
